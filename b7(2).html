         HIII, just wanted to share something ... here's another little gift
      You came into my life when I was lost, chasing illusions and attachments. There was a girl I liked… she rejected me — something I never imagined. I thought she was my entire world, that no one else could ever be mine. Ever. People scolded me, tried to make me understand — that I had put my own growth and improvement on pause for a girl, and that it would ruin me. But I didn’t pay attention. I couldn’t imagine anyone else but her. It was something like the movie "Raanjhanaa"… dammnn, I’m so cringe right no.
      but then it was you to have sent a text first , remember maine text ka reply nhi kra tha ? that was actually sort of intentional, but accidental as well.. usse baat ho rhi thi toh mai tumhe reply krna hi bhul gya.., par fir we had a little conversation , sbse pehle pehle mujhe lga tha ki koi ladki mujhse iss tareeke se kaise baat kr skti , no possibility on earth... Fir abhinav ne mujhe tumhare baare mein btaya , i mean jitna use pata tha , tuition wgera aur tumhare extrovert hone ke baare mein .. tbbhi maine koi khas dhyan diya nhi tha.. he kept saying us ldki ko bhul ja (am not taking her name cause you might recognise her so, but if you ask yourself i won't refuse tho) .. back to the story... fir like i skipped school for nearly a week and then thought a lot about it and just gave up on her.. i did realise sooner and then started working on myself ig i did tell you about that. 
      but then, slowly your character started to attract my attention .. and then in a short period of time , i did start liking everything about you. Like everything , and then on 7th july , tum mujhe acchi lgne lagi par kbhi mene tumhe propose krne ka socha nhi tha , mujhe lga tha jese dost h vese hi rehte h and one day we might actually end up together agar koi chance raha toh agar tum vese hi merese bat krti rhi toh  .. but on 8th of july , never thought ki koi ldki se mujhe proposal ayega and damn 
      ab mai khudko mana chuka hu , literally sapne aate h mujhe tumhare , and this is the second time ki kisi ldki ke spne aye mujhe par voh bhi har roj ,, i swear , aaj bhi (22-july) , tumhara sapna aya tha mujhe i swear to god... ab toh bhagwan bhi ishare krra h .. tumhe kya dikkat h ..

      I never thought a girl would propose to me. July 8th changed everything. Since then, I swear — you’re in my dreams every single night.
